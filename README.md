## Home Assistant Neviweb130 Custom Components

Custom components to suport [Neviweb](https://neviweb.com/) devices in [Home Assistant](http://www.home-assistant.io). 
Neviweb is a platform created by Sinopé Technologies to interact with their smart devices like thermostats, light switches/dimmers , load controllers, plug and water leak detector etc. 

Neviweb130 will manage the zigbee devices connected to Neviweb via the GT130 gateway and the new wifi devices. It is presently almost up to date with Neviweb but some informations are still missing from Sinopé. As new devices are launched by Sinopé, they are added to this custom-component. If you have a device that is not supported yet, please open an issue and I'll add it rapidly.

## Big changes for valve devices

Since version 2.6.2, valves devices are supported as new HA valve entities. They are no longer supported as switch. This will cause all your switch.neviweb130_switch_sedna_valve to be replaced by valve.neviweb130_valve_sedna_valve entities. You will need to revise your automation and cards to retreive your valve entities.

## Prerequisite
You need to connect your devices to a GT130 web gateway and add them in your Neviweb portal before being able to interact with them within Home Assistant. Please refer to the instructions manual of your device or visit [Neviweb support](https://www.sinopetech.com/blog/support-cat/plateforme-nevi-web/).

For wifi thermostats you need to connect your devices to Neviweb and add them in the same network then the GT130 zigbee devices.

There are two custom component giving you the choice to manage your devices via the neviweb portal or directly via local zigbee gateway:
- [Neviweb130](https://github.com/claudegel/sinope-130) custom component to manage your devices via neviweb portal
- Buy a zigbee gateway like Dresden Conbe II usb dongle and manage directly your zigbee device via ZHA component. I'm adding support for Sinopé zigbee in zha-device-handlers. You can test new Sinopé devices quirks in [sinope-zha](https://github.com/claudegel/sinope-zha) where I put all new quirks before they are merged into zha-device-handlers.

You need to install only one of them but both can be used at the same time on HA. Zigbee devices managed directly via Conbe II must be removed from Neviweb as they cannot be on two networks at the same time.

## Neviweb custom component to manage your device via Neviweb portal:
## Installation
There are two methods to install this custom component:
- via HACS component:
  - This repository is compatible with the Home Assistant Community Store ([HACS](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-component-hacs/121727)).
  - After installing HACS, install 'sinope-130' from the store, and use the configuration.yaml example below.
- Manually via direct download:
  - Download the zip file of this repository using the top right, green download button.
  - Extract the zip file on your computer, then copy the entire `custom_components` folder inside your Home Assistant `config` directory (where you can find your `configuration.yaml` file).
  - Your config directory should look like this:

    ```
    config/
      configuration.yaml
      custom_components/
        neviweb130/
          __init__.py
          light.py
          const.py
          switch.py
          climate.py
          sensor.py
          valve.py
          schema.py
          services.yaml
      ...
    ```
## Configuration

To enable Neviweb130 management in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file, then restart Home Assistant.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
neviweb130:
  username: 'your Neviweb username'
  password: 'your Neviweb password'
  network: 'your gt130 location name in Neviweb' (gt130 emplacement dans Neviweb)
  network2: 'your second location name in Neviweb' (2e emplacement)
  network3: 'your third location name in Neviweb' (3e emplacement)
  scan_interval: 360
  homekit_mode: False
  ignore_miwi: False
  stat_interval: 1800
  notify: "both"
```
Networks names are the names found on top of first page after loging into Neviweb. If you have more then one network, just click on icon on top to find all networks names. Select the one used for GT130 or wifi devices. Both device type must be on same network to work in neviweb130. If you have two networks for two GT130 or two wifi groups then you can add network2 parameter in your configuration.yaml. See below. You can't mix miwi devices and zigbee/wifi devices on the same network. For miwi devices install [Neviweb](https://github.com/claudegel/sinope-1) custom_component which can run along with this custom_component in HA.

![network](www/network.jpg)

**Configuration options:**  

| key | required | default | description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| **username** | yes |  | Your email address used to log in Neviweb.
| **password** | yes |  | Your Neviweb password.
| **network** | no | if not specified, 1st location found is used. Write the name of the GT130 location in Neviweb you want to control.| Network name is the location name in Neviweb written on top center of first page, where your wifi or zigbee devices are registered.
| **network2** | no | 2nd location found | The name of the second location you want to control (zigbee and/or wifi only). Don't add it if you have only one network.
| **network3** | no | 3rd location found | The name of the third location you want to control (zigbee and/or wifi only). Don't add it if you have only one network.
| **scan_interval** | no | 540 | The number of seconds between each access to Neviweb to update device state. Sinopé asked for a minimum of 5 minutes between polling now so you can reduce scan_interval to 300. Don't go over 600, the session will expire.
| **homekit_mode** | no | False | Add support for Homekit specific values. Not needed if you don't use homekit.
| **ignore_miwi** | no | False | Ignore miwi devices if present in same location then zigbee and/or wifi devices. Warm if we set wrong Neviweb location.
| **stat_interval** | no | 1800 | The number of seconds between each access to Neviweb for energy statistic update. Scan will start after 5 minutes from HA startup and will be updated at every 300 to 1800 seconds.
| **notify** | no | both | The method to send notification in case of device error. value option are nothing, logging, notification, both.

If you have a GT125 also connected to Neviweb the network parameter is mandatory or it is possible that during the setup, the GT125 network will be picked up accidentally. If you have only two GT130/wifi network, you can omit there names as during setup, the first two network found will be picked up automatically. If you prefer to add networs names make sure that they are written «exactly» as in Neviweb. (first letter capitalized or not). Avoid also accented letters as Home Assistant will remove them and location name won't match preventing custom_component loading.

## Sedna valve
For Sedna valve there is two way to connect it to Neviweb:
- Via wifi direct connection. This way leak sensor are connected directly to the Sedna valve which will close if leak is detected.
- via GT130 in zigbee mode. This  way leak sensor are also connected to the GT130 but on leak detection nothing is passed to the valve. You'll need to set some automation rule in Neviweb or HA, to have the Sedna valve close if leak is detected by sensor.

Both mode are supported by this custom component. 

## Gateway GT130
It is now possible to know if your GT130 is still online of offline with Neviweb via the gateway_status attribute. The GT130 is detected as sensor.neviweb130_sensor_gt130

## Custom services
Automations require services to be able to send commande. Ex. light.turn_on.

## Catch Éco Sinopé signal for peak period
If you have at least on thermostat or one load controler registered with Éco-Sinopé program, it is now possible to catch when Neviweb send the signal for pre-heating start period for thermostats or turn_off signal for the load controler. Seven attributes have been added for thermostats and three for load controler to know that peak period is comming and how it is managed:

- For thermostats:
  - **eco_status**: set to «off» during normal operation, turn «on» during peak period at the beginning of the pre-heating period. this is the attribute to follow to detect a peak start.
  - **eco_setpoint**: set to «off» during normal operation, turn «on» during peak period if device is managed by Eco-Sinopé.
  - **eco_optout**: set to «off» during normal operation during peak period, turn «on» if somebody change the setpoint during peak period.
  - **eco_power_relative**: set to «off» during normal operation, used to set a minimum temperature compared to setpoint where the thermostat will turn on automatically for frost protection.
  - **eco_power_absolute**: set to «off» during normal operation, used to limit the pi_heating_demand level between 1 to 100% during peak period.
  - **eco_setpoint_status**: set to «off» during normal operation, turn «on» if device setpoint is changed by Eco-Sinopé.
  - **eco_setpoint_delta**: set to 0 during normal operation, changed to values between -10 and +10 during peak period. For pre-heating the value is positive and for peak period it is a negative value. This is a delta applyed to regular setpoint. -10 = setpoint reduced by 10oC. +2 = setpoint increased by 2oC.

- For load controler:
  - **eco_status**: set to «off» during normal operation, turn «on» during peak period at the beginning of the pre-heating period. this is the attribute to follow to detect a peak start.
  - **eco_onoff**: set to «off» during normal operation, turn «on» during peak period if device is managed by Eco-Sinopé. The device is turned off during peak period. Nothing is done during pre-heating period.
  - **eco_optout**: set to «off» during normal operation during peak period, turn «on» if somebody turn on the device during peak period.

- For Multi-controller MC3100ZB:
  - **eco_status**: set to «off» during normal operation, turn «on» during peak period at the beginning of the pre-heating period. this is the attribute to follow to detect a peak start.
  - **eco_setpoint**: set to «off» during normal operation, no change during peak period if device is managed by Eco-Sinopé.
  - **eco_optout**: set to «off» during normal operation, during peak period, turn «on» if somebody change the onoff value during peak period.
  - **eco_power_relative**: set to «off» during normal operation, used to set a minimum temperature compared to room temperature value where the MC3100ZB will turn on automatically for frost protection.
  - **eco_power_absolute**: set to «off» during normal operation, usage unknown.

It is then possible to make an automation to set all HA devices ready for peak period by following the eco_status attribute change from «off» to «on».

## Statistic for energy
Seven attributes are added to track energy usage for devices:
- total_kwh_count: total count of energy usage to date.
- hourly_kwh_count:  total count for hourly usage for current day.
- daily_kwh_count: total count of water liters daily usage for current month.
- monthly_kwh_count: total count of water liters monthly usage for current year.
- hourly_kwh: kwh used for last hour.
- daily_kwh: kwh used for last day.
- monthly_kwh: kwh used for last month.

They are polled from Neviweb every 30 minutes. The first polling start 5 minutes after HA restart. Neviweb have a two hours delay to publish his data.

### Track energy consumption in HA Energy dashboard
When energy attributes are available, it is possible to track energy consumption of individual devices in Home Assistant energy dashboard by creating a [Template sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/) in configuration.yaml:
```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Basement energy usage"
        unique_id: sensor.basement_energy_usage
        unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
        device_class: energy
        state_class: total_increasing
        state: >-
          {{ state_attr("climate.neviweb130_th1124zb_basement","hourly_kwh_count") }}
```
or:
```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Basement energy usage"
        unique_id: sensor.basement_energy_usage
        unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
        device_class: energy
        state_class: total
        state: >-
          {{ state_attr("climate.neviweb130_th1124zb_basement","hourly_kwh") }}
```

## Statistic for Sedna flow sensor
Seven attributes are added to track water usage for Sedna valve. They are shown as m³ (cubic meeter) which is what energy module is looking for:
- total_flow_count: total count of water liters usage to date.
- hourly_flow_count:  total count of hourly water liters usage for current day.
- daily_flow_count: total count of daily water liters usage for current month.
- monthly_flow_count: total count of monthly water liters usage for current year.
- hourly_flow: water liters used for last hour.
- daily_flow: water liters used for last day.
- monthly_flow: water liters used for last month.

They are polled from Neviweb every 30 minutes. The first polling start 5 minutes after HA restart. Neviweb have a two hours delay to publish his data.

### Track water consumption in HA Energy dashboard
When flow attributes are available, it is possible to track water consumption of sedna valve in Home Assistant energy dashboard by creating a [Template sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/) in configuration.yaml:
```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Sedna Water Flow"
        unique_id: sensor.sedna_water_flow
        unit_of_measurement: "m³"
        device_class: water
        state_class: total_increasing
        state: >-
          {{ state_attr("valve.neviweb130_valve_water_valve","hourly_flow_count") }}
```
or:
```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Sedna Water Flow"
        unique_id: sensor.sedna_water_flow
        unit_of_measurement: "m³"
        device_class: water
        state_class: total
        state: >-
          {{ state_attr("valve.neviweb130_valve_water_valve","hourly_flow") }}
```

## Troubleshooting
if you see your device in the log but it do not apear in entity list you need to add the device model number in the code. Or you can send the model number to me so I can add it in the code.

In the log look for lines:
```yaml
[custom_components.neviweb130] Received gateway data: [{'id': 100225, 'identifier': '500b91400001f750', 'name': 'Chargeur auto', 'family': '2506',...
[custom_components.neviweb130] Received signature data: {'signature': {'model': 2506, 'modelCfg': 0, 'softBuildCfg': 0, 'softVersion': {'minor': 9, 'middle': 2, 'major': 1}, 'hardRev': 2, 'protocol': 'sinopcom'}}
```
'family': '2506' and 'model': 2506 is what you need to find the model number of your device. It should be added in climate.py, light.py, switch.py or sensor.py near line 132 to 136 (climate.py) depending on device type. Than restart HA and your device will be listed in entity list.

If you get a stack trace related to a Neviweb130 component in your `home-assistant.log` file, you can file an issue in this repository.

You can also post in one of those threads to get help:
- https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sinope-line-voltage-thermostats/17157

### Turning on Neviweb130 debug messages in `home-assistant.log` file

To have a maximum of information to help you, please provide a snippet of your `home-assistant.log` file. I've added some debug log messages that could help diagnose the problem.

Add thoses lines to your `configuration.yaml` file
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: warning
     logs:
       custom_components.neviweb130: debug
       homeassistant.service: debug
       homeassistant.config_entries: debug
   ```
This will set default log level to warning for all your components, except for Neviweb which will display more detailed messages.

### Error messages received from Neviweb
In you log you can get those messages from Neviweb:
- VALINVLD : Invalid value sent to Neviweb.
- ACCDAYREQMAX : Maximun daily request reached...Reduce polling frequency.
- TimeoutError : Timeout error detected...Retry later.
- MAINTENANCE : Neviweb access temporary blocked for maintenance...Retry later.
- SVCINVREQ: Invalid request sent to Neviweb, service do not exist or malformed request.
- DVCCOMMTO: Device Communication Timeout: device do not respond fast enough or you are polling that device too frequently.
- DVCACTNSPTD: Device action not supported. Service call is not supported for that specific device.
- USRSESSEXP: User session expired. Reduce your scan_intervall below 6 minutes or your session will be terminated.
- ACCSESSEXC: To many open session at the same time. This is common if you restart Home Assistant many time and/or you also have an open session on Neviweb. 
- DVCUNVLB: Device unavailable. Neviweb is unable to connect with specific device, mostly wifi devices.
- DVCBUSY: Neviweb is performing an update and devices are not available. Try later.
- SVCERR: Service error. Service unavailable. Try later.
- DVCATTRNSPTD: Device sttribute not supported, The device you have installed have and older firmware and do not support som attributes. Wait for firmware update in Neviweb and the error should dissapear or file an issue so we can put an exception in the code. 
- USRBADLOGIN: your login and/or password provided in configuration for Neviweb is no good.
- ReadTimeout: Request was sent to the device but no answer came back. Network problem.

## Customization
Install  [Custom-Ui](https://github.com/Mariusthvdb/custom-ui) custom_component via HACS and add the following in your code:

Icons for heat level: create folder www in the root folder .homeassistant/www
copy the six icons there. You can find them under local/www
feel free to improve my icons and let me know. (See icon_view2.png)

For each thermostat add this code in `customize.yaml`
```yaml
climate.neviweb_climate_thermostat_name:
  templates:
    entity_picture: >
      if (attributes.heat_level < 1) return '/local/heat-0.png';
      if (attributes.heat_level < 21) return '/local/heat-1.png';
      if (attributes.heat_level < 41) return '/local/heat-2.png';
      if (attributes.heat_level < 61) return '/local/heat-3.png';
      if (attributes.heat_level < 81) return '/local/heat-4.png';
      return '/local/heat-5.png';
 ```  
 In `configuration.yaml` add this
```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize: !include customize.yaml
``` 
## Customization for leak sensor

Same as above. 
-Create a sensor:
```yaml
battery_spa:
        friendly_name: "Batterie spa"
        unit_of_measurement: "%"
        value_template: "{{ state_attr('sensor.neviweb130_sensor_spa', 'Battery_level') }}"
```        
-For each leak detector add this to your `customize.yaml` file
```yaml
sensor.battery_spa:
  templates:
    entity_picture: >
      if (entity.state < 10) return '/local/battery-1.png';
      if (entity.state < 30) return '/local/battery-2.png';
      if (entity.state < 50) return '/local/battery-3.png';
      if (entity.state < 70) return '/local/battery-4.png';
      return '/local/battery-5.png';
sensor.neviweb130_sensor_spa:    
      if (attributes.Leak_status == "ok") return ''/local/drop.png'';
      return ''/local/leak.png'';'
```
Icons are availables from www directory. copy them in config/www

# Device hard reset:
- Thermostats:
    - Raise the temperature until the display change.
    - Push the two button until CLR appear on the screen.
    - Push once the upper button to get YES on the display.
    - Push both button simutanously and release immediately. DONE should appear on the screen.
    - The thermostat will restart with factory setup

- thermostats G2:
    - Raise the temperature until the display change.
    - Push and hold the two button until RST appear on the screen.
    - Wait until device restart.

## TO DO
- when this component will be stable. Merge it with The Neviweb component to poll all devices from only one component.
